# Monorepo Structure & General Rules

## Codebase Splits
The monorepo contains three distinct codebases:
1. **Docker**: Located in `stacks/` (for Proxmox services).
2. **ArgoCD**: (Reserved/Implied).
3. **Terraform**: Located in `terraform/`.

## Global Constraints
- **NEVER create README.md files**. They are not needed.
- **Minimal File Creation**: Do not create auxiliary files unless they are highly required.

## Directory Purpose
- `stacks/`: Contains Docker Compose stacks. This directory is `rsynced` to the Portainer host and **should not contain any data** (only config).
- `terraform/`: Infrastructure as Code definitions.
