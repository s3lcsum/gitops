# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant architectural decisions made in this project. Each ADR describes the context, the decision, and the consequences — helping future maintainers understand *why* things are the way they are.

## ADR Process

1. **When to write an ADR**: When making a decision that's hard to reverse, affects multiple components, or involves choosing between meaningful alternatives.
2. **How to write one**: Copy `0000-template.md`, fill it in, and number it sequentially.
3. **Status**: ADRs can be `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, or `superseded`.
