# 🏠 Welcome in my Home(Lab)

This repository contains all configuration and documentation for my hobbist
homelab setup.

The goal is to track infrastructure changes, automate as much as possible, and
provide a living reference for improvements. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Proxmox VE** - Hypervisor for running containers and VMs
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code tool
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** - Container runtime and orchestration
- **Portainer** - Docker management UI (deployed via Terraform)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gitops
   ```

2. **Configure Terraform variables**:
   - Copy `default.auto.tfvars` files in each terraform module
   - Update variables according to your environment
   - Set up authentication credentials for your providers

3. **Deploy infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy Proxmox infrastructure
   cd terraform/proxmox
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply

   # Deploy Portainer and stacks
   cd ../portainer
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply

   # Configure other modules as needed
   cd ../authentik
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Each stack has `.env.example` files
   - Copy to `.env` and configure according to your setup
   - Update secrets and passwords

### Usage

- **Managing Stacks**: Use Portainer UI or Terraform to deploy/update stacks
- **Monitoring**: Access services through Traefik reverse proxy
- **Authentication**: Use Authentik for SSO across services
- **Logs**: View container logs through Dozzle
- **Metrics**: Monitor infrastructure through Grafana Cloud integration

## Changelog

### 7.07.2025

Major infrastructure changes:
- Replaced Nginx Proxy Manager with **Traefik** as the reverse proxy
- Added **CrowdSec** security integration with Traefik
- Added **mediabox** stack to start fun with home media server
- Removed VictoriaMetrics stack (moved to Grafana Cloud)
- Updated all stack configurations to use Traefik labels

### 25.05.2025

Refactored the Terraform code slightly to reduce repetition. I also removed
'watchtower' —it's a great tool, but I prefer to update everything manually,
and RenovateBot will handle the rest.

### 21.05.2025

I have configured the Google SSO for Authentik with the terraform. However, I
did some changes manually in the UI for the flows/stages, as they're super
difficult to configure via terraform.

### 20.05.2025

I have just refactored Portainer stacks, so I won't have to deal with many
resources, but have done it all in a single array. Before, I thought it would
be better this way, but it wasn't worth it.

### 18.05.2025

I'm reverting from Portainer's GitOps option that was automatically pulling
stacks from this repository. The delay between commits and actual changes in
Portainer was frustrating. Plus, I couldn't make any temporary changes in
stacks. I'd rather execute `terraform apply` to keep everything in one place.

### 17.05.2025

Because I accidentally deleted my authentik environment variables, I decided to
give authelia a shot. I've heard only good things about it, and it's fully
configurable via YAML files. It seemed promising, but I felt like I was missing
some options that worked perfectly out-of-the-box in authentik. I tried to
configure it, but ended up restoring authentik from backup anyway.

### Key Relationships:

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Proxmox VE runs on physical servers, hosting LXC containers
- **Container Layer**: Portainer LXC manages all Docker stacks and services
- **Network Layer**: Services communicate through dedicated Docker networks:
  - `proxy`: Routes traffic through Traefik reverse proxy
  - `metrics`: Collects metrics and logs for monitoring
  - `authentik`: Internal network for Authentik SSO components
- **Security Layer**:
  - Traefik handles SSL termination and routing
  - CrowdSec provides DDoS protection and security
  - Authentik provides SSO and identity management
- **External Integration**:
  - Cloudflare for DNS and CDN
  - Grafana Cloud for metrics and monitoring
  - NAS for storage and backups

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Network Segmentation**: Services are isolated using Docker networks and Traefik routing
- **Authentication**: Authentik provides SSO and MFA for all services
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik with CrowdSec integration for DDoS protection
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables and Docker secrets (consider HashiCorp Vault for production)
- **Updates**: Manual updates preferred over automatic for stability
- **Backups**: Regular backups to Synology NAS
