1. ArgoCD has been deployed with two projects:
   - argocd: For ArgoCD self-management
   - homelab: For all your homelab infrastructure and applications

2. Access ArgoCD UI:
   - Get the admin password:
     kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

   - Port forward to access UI:
     kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443

   - Login at: https://localhost:8080
     Username: admin
     Password: (from step above)

3. ApplicationSets created:
   - homelab-applicationsets: Automatically deploys all charts from your repo
   - Applications will be named: homelab-{chart-name}

4. Verify deployment:
   kubectl get applications -n argocd
   kubectl get applicationsets -n argocd
   kubectl get appprojects -n argocd

5. All charts in your repo will be automatically deployed to their respective namespaces:
   {{- $charts := list "cert-manager" "traefik" "kyverno" "tailscale" "postgres" "n8n" "grafana-agent" }}
   {{- range $charts }}
   - homelab-{{ . }}: deployed to {{ . }} namespace
   {{- end }}

6. Monitor sync status:
   kubectl get applications -n argocd -w

The homelab project has full cluster access and will manage all your infrastructure!
